# E04a-Sprites Exercise
Hello! This code plays around with sprites. 

* main1.py 
main1.py uses a loop to show 20 randomly chosen animals from the animal assets list.

* main2.py
main2.py displays two animal sprites and two emote sprites corresponding to the animals. 

* main3.py
main3.py uses on_mouse_motion to allow the sprite to follow the mouse.

* main4.py
main4.py (extra credit) uses sprites of our choosing to display on the screen.
